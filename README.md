# Sassing Up Bootstrap

In this activity we will be learning how to utilize Sass in a Bootstrap project. Bootstrap's styles are written with Sass and allows you to utilize said Sass files to take advantage of variables, maps, mixins, and more. Throughout this activity you will be introduced to the major advantages of pairing Sass with Bootstrap. In order to utilize its Sass files they must either be downloaded or installed as an [_npm package_](https://www.npmjs.com/) which we'll delve into in a later module. In the meantime all npm packages will be installed and pre-configured for you.
